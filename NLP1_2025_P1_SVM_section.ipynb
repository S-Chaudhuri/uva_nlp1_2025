        "Section 1: Lexicon Based Approach, defining a lexicon for sentiment classification is one of the oldest approaches in the book. This method uses predefined polarity of each word, to calculate the overall polarity of a review. The original perfomance (Q1.3 = 0.6775) shows that the model does learn some patterns. With implimenting weights on higher intensity positive polarity words we can see the increase in performance (Q1.4 = 0.689). This shows that the model now takes into account the magnitude, of a polarity. To accomodate the varing sizes of the documents, we introduce a dynamic threshold leading to a similar performance (Q1.5 = 0.688), the marginally lower accuracy can be due to the dynamic threshold as the fixed threshold (8) is predefined as optimal. So a dynamic threshold with differing values for a majority of average length reviews may be the reason.(more differing lengths will lead to higher performance).(146 words)\n",

        "Section 2: The naive bayes classifier in its most bare bones form is not very good at sentiment analysis, but with different techniques it is still possible to make it a decent sentiment classifier. The biggest increase in performance across the 9 questions we made was achieved when smoothing was introduced (Q2.2 = 0.495, Q2.4 = 0.825/0.845), which is logical because it allows the model to handle words it is not familiar with. The biggest decrease came from the unbalanced training set from Q2.3 (Q2.2 = 0.495, Q2.3 = 0.09090909090909091). The disproportionate amount of positive and negative reviews during training skewed the results in such a bad manner because during training the model could always guess positive and still get 90% accuracy.

The ability to learn the relations between POS and SVM with its capability to train on higher dimensional and sparse data leads to a good model with a high accuracy.\n",
